==========

GBA emulator for the 3DS based on [vba-next](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next). Currently runs slowly and has no sound.

When ingame, touch the screen to open the file selector. Touch again to resume the game. When in the file selector, press A to select something, B to go back a directory, and START to close the emulator.
